# KaNote manual

## Introduction 

KaNote is a minimalist note and task manager. Tasks or notes are stored in databases and can be organized in thematic folders. These notes can contain different resources (images, attachments, ...), link various alarms and be enriched with custom attributes. KaNote also integrates a minimalist language with which you can automate tasks. In addition to the task manager, you can give KaNote other uses, for example a small content manager.

Two different database engines are supported, Sqlite for personal tasks and SQL server for corporate use.

KaNote also has two different front-ends, an old-school Windows desktop application (WinForm app) and a Web application (Blazor app).
